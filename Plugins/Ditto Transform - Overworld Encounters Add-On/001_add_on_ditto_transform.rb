# Ditto Transform - Overworld Encounters Add-On * by derFischae
#===============================================================================

# This is an add-on for the visible overworld wild encounter script.
# It adds automatic pokemon spawning to the script.

# FEATURES INCLUDED:
#  - Like in Pokemon Go, transformable Pokemon such as Ditto get the overworld appearence of different species
#  - Choose in settings if completely random, set by a list of candidates or set by the map encounters

# INSTALLATION:
# 1) Place the folder of this plugin in your plugins folder
# 2) Open the file add_on_automatic_spawning.rb and change the parameter TRANSFORMS to your liking in the settings section.

#    Settings

module VisibleEncounterSettings
  TRANSFORMS = [                      # default
    [:DITTO],                         # means - Ditto will have any overworld appearence of encounters of the map where you are
    [:MEW, nil]                      #       - Mew will have overworld appearence of any random species
  ]
  # This parameter is used to change the overworld appearence of pokemon such as ditto.
  # The data is stored as an array of arrays. You can add your own arrays.
  # The first entry  - is the the species that transforms its overworld appearence.
  # No more entries  - means the species have any overworld appearence of encounters of the map where the player is.
  # nil              - means the species will have overworld appearence of any random species.
  # species names    - means the species will have random overworld appearence of one of that following species.
