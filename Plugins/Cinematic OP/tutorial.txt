How it works
When you start the game (not in debug mode), the two splash screens will appear, your custom video will play and then the title screen will appear.

Plugin Steps:
1-Extract the plugin into your game. 
2-Place your custom .ogv video in Movies folder
3-Within the config settings set the name of the video (do not include extension, it assumes the video is .ogv)
4-IMPORTANT!! Compile your game in debug mode every time you make changes
5-Play Game (DO NOT PLAY DEBUG MODE! It skips the opening)

*Included test opening (VideoOut.ogv), so you can plug, compile and play to make sure everything is working before replacing it with your own custom opening. 

*Update 11/13: This plugin is now compatible with Luka's Modular Title Screen 2.2.2 using Essentials v21.1.

– Video Prepping –
Before converting to .ogv, your video needs to be prepped. In essentials 21.1, the video playback is being processed by your cpu, 
so your results will vary depending on the original quality of the media and of course, your cpu. When you export your media for
the first time, you will want to avoid high bitrates, frame rates and resolutions. I have experienced a lot of wonkiness when testing 
with higher quality videos. The bugs range from game crashing with no errors, game lag, video lag/ crashing, no audio/ not in sync.  

Before creating your video, you will need a few things. 
Access your devices command prompt
A video editor that allows you to export your video as a .avi format using a low quality encoder
Installation of ffmpeg (Recommendation: use gyan ffmpeg)


Create your video using whatever video editing software you are using; I am using premiere pro. 
The settings don’t have to be exact but frame size dimensions should be common sizes (no 546x329). 
If you find other settings that work, make sure to share with the community. REMEMBER: Do not export media with  high bitrates, 
frame rates and resolutions; Doing so may result in bugs/ weird issues that I cannot help with 

Recommended Media Export settings:
Format: .avi 
Video codec: Microsoft RLE or Microsoft Video 1
Frame Size: 640 x 480 
Frame Rate: 24 or below


Take your new .avi and drop in a folder. Preferably, one easy to find via command window

—Video Conversion—
Next, you will need to convert your media into an .ogv. I’m sure there are various ways to accomplish this, 
but I strictly use ffmpeg for conversion (it's free). If you use another method and experience bugs, I cannot help. 
I won’t go over how to find or install ffmpeg, but I will recommend installing gyan’s ffmpeg. Once installed, 
make sure to open the command window and verify installation by checking what version you have

Paste the following command to check the ffmpeg version:  
ffmpeg -version

Once ffmpeg is ready, locate the folder where you put your .avi video via the command window.

Paste the following command (do not hit enter until you change names): 
ffmpeg -i VideoIn.avi -b:a 128K -q:v 7 -pix_fmt yuv420p VideoOut.ogv

* Change VideoIn to your created videos name; Change VideoOut to whatever you want output video name to be (or leave it to keep name)

* If you wish to use the .ogg format, change the VideoOut extension to .ogg. Within plugin (line 47) change 
extension to .ogg; Warning: I have not tested .ogg as long as .ogv for bugs/errors. 
If you have issues, switch to .ogv (so far I have had none)

Once it is done converting, place video into your Game -> Movies folder, configure your settings and you're good to go!
