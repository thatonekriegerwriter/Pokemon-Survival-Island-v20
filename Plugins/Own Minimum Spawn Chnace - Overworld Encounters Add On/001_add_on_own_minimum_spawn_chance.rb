# As we all know, it is annoying to run into the next wild battle just a few steps after your last one.
# That's why Pokemon Essentials v19 implements an encounter chance that is low after a wild battle and
# increases each step. So, it might suppress 8 pokemons to spawn, before a new pokemon encounters.
# This is totally fine for normal encounters. Unfortunately, this might result in an odd behaviour for spawning encounters, since the encounter chance will be reset after a battle and not after a pokemon has spawned.
# it will take long for the first pokemon to spawn, and then it will be fast and gets even faster the more steps the game player makes, until the game player runs into a pokemon and triggers a battle.

# This Add-On gets rid of this odd behaviour.

# FEATURES
# [*] The Spawn probability of the first encounter and later ones are similar.
# [*] Spawning does not interact with the encounter chance for normal encounters.
# [*] Increase the average spawning time of pokeon by setting MAX_ENCOUNTER_REDUCED larger than zero in the settings section of this script

# SETTINGS
module VisibleEncounterSettings
  #------------- MAXIMAL NUMBER OF ENCOUNTERS WITH REDUCED ENCOUNTER PROBABILITY ------------ 
  MAX_ENCOUNTER_REDUCED = 0 # default 8 - means that at most 8 pokemon will have a drastically reduced spawn probability before it become the usual encounter probability
  # 0   - means that all pokemon have the encounter probability as it is set by you for the maps and the encounter type, grass, cave, water.
  # >0  - means that the first at most that given number of pokemon will have a drastically reduced spawn probability and might not make it. This will increase the average spawning time for every pokemon.
