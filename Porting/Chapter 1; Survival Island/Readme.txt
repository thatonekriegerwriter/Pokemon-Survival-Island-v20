Thanks for downloading and using Voltseon's Trainer Generator

The script comes with an example map located in the Data folder.


If you are unsure for how to use the example map, here are instructions:

1) Open your game in RPG Maker XP
2) Create a new map with the default settings
3) Get the Map ID for the map you just created
4) Hit the save button in RPG Maker XP
5) Close RPG Maker XP
6) Rename the provided example map to 'MapXXX', replacing XXX to the Map ID you got in step 3
	So for example, if the map you created has the id 44 then rename the file to Map044
7) Import the example map into your Data folder
8) It will ask you if you would like to replace the file, click yes
9) Open RPG Maker XP again and you should see the example map
10) Have fun with VTG!

(Don't forget to change your Common Event, everything is in the whale in the example map)
