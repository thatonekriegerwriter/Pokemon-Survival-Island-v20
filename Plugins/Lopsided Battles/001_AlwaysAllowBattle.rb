### Force double battles even if player only has one pokemon
class Battle
    #=============================================================================
    # Makes sure all Pokémon exist that need to. Alter the type of battle if
    # necessary. Will never try to create battler positions, only delete them
    # (except for wild Pokémon whose number of positions are fixed). Reduces the
    # size of each side by 1 and tries again. If the side sizes are uneven, only
    # the larger side's size will be reduced by 1 each time, until both sides are
    # an equal size (then both sides will be reduced equally).

      #       because they cannot move into a position owned by a different
      #       trainer, it's possible that battlers will be unable to move close
