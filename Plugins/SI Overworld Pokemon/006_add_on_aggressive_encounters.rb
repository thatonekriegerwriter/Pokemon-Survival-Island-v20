# ADD-ON: Aggressive Encounters
#=======================================================================

# This ADD-ON introduces aggressive encounters, which are pokemon that follow the player after spawning.
# 
# You can set the move speed and movee frequency of aggressive pokemon.
# 
# FEATURES:
#  - introduces aggressive encounters, which are pokemon that chase the player after spawning
#  - aggressive encounters may only start to chase if the player comes them to close
#  - set the move speed, move frequency and move type of aggressive pokemon
#  - aggressive ecounters are restricted to player movements
#  - add animations to aggressive encounters. See Additional Animations -Add On and TrankerGolD's animations for aggressive encounters
#    at https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10395100&postcount=383 to include spawning animations in your game


# SETTINGS

module VisibleEncounterSettings
  AGGRESSIVE_ENCOUNTER_PROBABILITY = 60 # default 20 
  #this is the probability in percent of spawning of an aggressive encounter, that runs to you
  #0   - means that there are no aggressive encounters
  #100 - means that all encounter are aggressive

  AGG_ENC_SPAWN_MOVEMENT = [3, 4, 3] # default [3, 5, 3] -  means that aggressive encounters will be faster and run to the player
  # This is used to store the movement data of aggressive encounters. 
  # The data is stored as an array of entries [move_speed, move_frequency, move_type],
  # where move_speed, move_frequency and move_type and  are the movement speed,
  # frequency and type all aggressive encounters should get.
  # nil  - means that the movement-parameter will not be changed.
  # move_type = 1  - means random movement
  # move_type = 3  - means movement toward player

  AGG_ENC_SWITCH_MOVEMENT = [3, 3, 3] # default [3, 5, 2] -  means that aggressive encounters will be faster and run to the player
  # This is used to store the movement data of aggressive encounters. 
  # The data is stored as an array of entries [move_speed, move_frequency, move_type],
  # where move_speed, move_frequency and move_type and  are the movement speed,
  # frequency and type all aggressive encounters should get.
  # nil  - means that the movement-parameter will not be changed.
  # move_type = 1  - means random movement
  # move_type = 2  - means movement toward player


  ADD_STEPS_BEFORE_AGG_ENC_VANISH = 6 # default 6 - means that spawned aggressive pokemon will stay longer (6 steps more) on the map
  # This is the number of additional steps (of less steps if the number is negative) an aggressive pokemon takes before it vanishes.

  AGG_ON_DISTANCE = 3 # default 2
  # This is an integer
  #  0  - means the aggressive pokemon will not switch its movement when player is close to the pokemon
  # >0  - means the aggressive pokemon will switch its movement when the player is at most that much tiles away

  AGG_ANIMATIONS = [28, nil, nil] # default [7, nil, nil]
  # This stores the IDs of your animations in database, where the first animation
  # 1st entry  - the id of the animation in database that triggers when a pokemon becomes aggressive if the player comes it to close.
  # 2nd entry  - the id of the animation in database that triggers on spawning of the aggressive encounter (needs additional animations add on)
  # 3rd entry  - the id of the animation in database that plays permanently as long as the pokemon is on the screen (needs additional animations add on)
  #  nil  - means no animation
  # So create new animations in database. See also TrankerGolD's animations for aggressive encounters at https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10395100&postcount=383
  # Don't forget to edit animation_id in settings script (line 199),
  #     (if the id number is bigger than the database number of animations it will crash the game).
